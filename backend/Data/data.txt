Speaker 0:

Alright. So let's, let's start. Last time we saw you was in end of May, and what we discussed in end of May was, your liver enzymes are high, and we'll discuss about that. We increased the trulicity to 1.5 milligrams. You're on that now?

Mhmm. Okay. You're tolerating it well? Yes. And no vomiting, no nausea, no diarrhea, no constipation, no abdominal pain?

Yes. And how and how much dujeo are you on now?

Speaker 1:

You told me to move up to 70. Okay.

Speaker 0:

You're still on 70.

Speaker 1:

I am And like 140 to 150.

Speaker 0:

So still a little bit high, but much better than before. Yeah. Good night. And then diet exercise to lose weight. We sent a referral to doctor Addison's office in Lila.

Speaker 1:

Not been able to, but I will try again today. I tried this morning, nothing. And so I'll try a little bit later.

Speaker 0:

K. And then, we said continue the thyroid replacement. Last time, TSH was very high. Still high, but we it is better now, but we'll get to that. And diet exercise and lose weight.

So that's what we discussed last time. So let's come to today. And, today your Blood pressure is 138 over 70. Your weight is exactly the same, sir. You you are 261.9 last time, 261.7 now.

So I would I was hoping you'd have lost, some weight. What what happened?

Speaker 1:

I went on a cruise and I didn't really diet. I'm not even gonna lie.

Speaker 0:

Okay. Things happen but had you lost the weight and you gained some back or you really

Speaker 1:

I did. I I was I lost a good, like, I would well, I don't know because y'all's scale might be a little bit different. But I was at 2.50 something. Okay. So I had lost a good £10.

Speaker 0:

Okay. And, you are taking 150 microgram 250 micrograms of Levothyroxine. Mhmm. You took take it on empty stomach. Right.

Not with other pills. Not with food.

Speaker 1:

And I I do usually take my insulin at that time.

Speaker 0:

Yes. But should not matter. Okay. But orally, you don't take anything else. And then you take rosuvastatin 10?

Yes. You are taking it?

Speaker 1:

Yes. Oh,

Speaker 0:

how long you've been on the rosuvastatin now?

Speaker 1:

For a while now. A

Speaker 0:

while now. Okay. Chest pain, trouble breathing, coughing, fever, chills, headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, no bowel movement,

Speaker 1:

no red blood, no blood and stones, no blast fluid? No. Breathe.

Speaker 0:

K. Art of the normal skin swelling. No calluses, sore, wounds, stinging, numbness, feel free.

Speaker 1:

You too. Look at this. I don't know. Does that look like what is this? Her eyesight on my elbow?

It gets worse than that sometimes.

Speaker 0:

It does look like psoriasis. It does look like psoriasis. And what is the

Speaker 1:

Both of those yes. Both elbows.

Speaker 0:

Yes. It does look like psoriasis.

Speaker 1:

What are the things? Like, what are they like, I've been itching. Obviously, that's why they look like that. But like that one, kinda like the way they are. See all my

Speaker 0:

No. This looks like psoriasis. This probably that too. So mild psoriasis, first we do steroid cream. Have you applied psoriasis?

No.

Speaker 1:

I wanted to ask you

Speaker 0:

about So I will prescribe you some steroid cream, high potency steroid cream. Let's start with that.

Speaker 1:

Okay.

Speaker 0:

If that doesn't help, then maybe refer to dermatologists to consider or test out something, stronger for psoriasis. But first, start with simple things. Okay. But that does look like psoriasis. Okay.

Okay. Let's get to the blood work then. Okay? Your a one c 7.3, dramatically better than before.

Speaker 1:

What was it before?

Speaker 0:

I'm gonna check. I think when we started, it was, like, crazy more than 14 or something.

Speaker 1:

Oh my god. Okay.

Speaker 0:

Yes. So it is dramatically better. Your TSH is down to 12. Okay. Yes.

12.7. At one time, it was 100, then it was 65, then it was 50, and now it is 12.7. 50.

Speaker 1:

I remember it was at 261 at one point.

Speaker 0:

I know. Wow. So so it's dramatically better, and you feel better. Right? You look better.

You feel better, but it's still not where it should be. I mean, we we can go a little bit higher. And I feel nervous giving any higher, but, what the endocrinologist tell me is if you need higher, you need to take higher. In your case, you need to take higher. Mhmm.

Because your t four is 1, and the range is between 0.8 to 1.8. So one is still at the lower end. So I what what I'm saying is you can do it a little bit more. So 275. 275.

Okay. Then there is no way to make it 275.

Speaker 1:

I have the 50. You'll have to prescribe me at, like, 25.

Speaker 0:

Yes. The other thing to do is go to 300. I mean, that will be a huge dose, but, I think So we

Speaker 1:

can lower it if Yeah.

Speaker 0:

So let's go to 300 because, in your case, I would like it less than 5. Okay. Okay. So 100, 65, 50, 12.75, 12.7. So I think 300 might be the dose.

So we'll go to 300.

Speaker 1:

Okay.

Speaker 0:

So if you start feeling very anxious, hard, sweaty all the time, hard time sleeping, then, then it is too much.

Speaker 1:

Okay. How far you k. That?

Speaker 0:

But for now, we'll go to 300. Okay? Now the rest the the cholesterol is still very, very high. Okay?

Speaker 1:

I'm I'm not even gonna lie. I've been doing that.

Speaker 0:

But you're taking the rest of our statin?

Speaker 1:

Yeah. We've been eating a lot of red meat compared to usual. I'm I need to go back to just eating my chicken again.

Speaker 0:

And the liver enzymes were, are are are about the same. Okay? So they were 214, 263, 144. So if anything, slightly better, but not dramatically better. Okay?

And you did your ultrasound of your liver, which showed a very large liver. So, basically, fatty liver, the treatment of that is aggressive weight loss, which Trulicity should help, but but we have not lost it yet. Okay? Your total cholesterol, 272, 275, 258. So that is better, but triglycerides are still very high at 721.

Now we should go to 20 milligrams of rosuvastatin. Okay. Okay? And then once you end up seeing doctor Addison, then she can decide if to add Fenofibrate. Okay.

Fenofibrate is for triglycerides. So you have cholesterol problem and you have a triglyceride problem. Honestly, she might put you on what is called as Repatha. Repatha is an injection twice a month every 2 weeks for, for very high cholesterols like you have. So your, cholesterols are high, total cholesterol and triglycerides.

So she might end up putting on Repatha, which would be appropriate, but I would like you to see it. So for die so for cholesterol, 20 of rosuvastatin. For thyroid, 300 micrograms of foliotaroxins. Coming to the diabetes. Now, Trulicity, I would like to increase the dose further, but I don't even know if it is available.

Speaker 1:

Just next. Okay.

Speaker 0:

Sorry about that. So, come coming to the diabetes, I would like to go to 3 milligrams of Trulicity. The difficulty of 3 milligrams of Trulicity is finding it.

Speaker 1:

Okay.

Speaker 0:

So I'll prescribe Trulicity 3 milligrams. Okay? Okay. If you don't, how much more of the 1.5 do you still have?

Speaker 1:

I think I have 2 vials.

Speaker 0:

Two injections?

Speaker 1:

You need 2 injections.

Speaker 0:

So I will prescribe 3 milligrams. If you cannot find it, you're gonna have to call us and then we'll prescribe the 1.5. Hopefully, that is there. Okay. Have you ever, discussed about adding Jardiance for decreasing your blood sugar further?

No. Jardiance is a pill. You pee out sugar. When the sugars are very, very high like they were before, I don't like to give it because then you pee out tremendous amount of sugar and you get dehydrated. Now that your, sugars are better, but still not where we want it, we can add jardiance.

So you will pee out sugar. You have to keep, you know, good hygiene or else you can get yeast infections. If you get yeast infection, you have to use monostat. If it if it happens repeatedly, then we simply have to stop it. Okay?

For diabetes going back, Trulicity 3 milligrams, Jardiance 10 milligrams once a day, it's a pill. Okay. As a result, your sugars might start going low. Okay. And if your sugar start going low, you start cutting back your insulin.

Okay. So your blood sugar start going consistently below a 110 fasting, then you could cut back the insulin by 10 units.

Speaker 1:

Okay.

Speaker 0:

And and as you do aggressive diet and exercises with medication, you might have to go 60, 50, 40. So the minimum dose of insulin you use, better it is. Because the insulin makes you gain weight while all these other medication make you lose weight. Okay. Okay?

Eye exam, you have done that, this year?

Speaker 1:

No. Not yet. I'm going to.

Speaker 0:

Excellent. So let's recap. Trulicity 3 milligrams, if you don't find it in the pharmacy, call us then we go back to 1.5. Jardiance 10 milligrams, once a day. Mhmm.

Rosuvastatin will be 20. And the levothyroxine will be 300. So basically, 3 pills of 100 because it doesn't come in 300 milligram pills. Call doctor Edison's office because I'm not sure the 20 of the sirostatin is gonna be enough. And then let me see in case the cortisol level is back, which I don't think so.

That'll take time. If the cortisol level is high, then obviously we'll have a different discussion. Mhmm. Questions? No.

Next time, I want to see you at, 251 by our scale.

Speaker 1:

Okay.

Speaker 0:

£10. You can do it.

Speaker 1:

Yes.

Speaker 0:

Okay? Alright, Jessica. Alright.

Speaker 1:

Thank you.

Speaker 0:

Take care.

Speaker 1:

We'll see you later.

Speaker 0:

Yes. And, that will be for your next visit. 3 months.

Speaker 1:

3 months. Okay. Thank you.

Speaker 0:

Yep.
